      How was Nolan's Q train ride?
    </h1>
    <div id=info>
    <p>
      I ride the the Q train most days at about 8AM.
      I ride it from Parkside ave in Brooklyn to work in midtown Manhattan.
    </p>

    <p>
      I built a slack app to ask me how the Q ride was every day. This page
      contains my responses to those prompts. One day I will built a model to
      predict my ride quality in advance, so that I might use another line if
      a bad ride is forecasted.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ratings are entirely subjective. "bad" ratings generally involve
      delays so bad that I have to switch lines. "ok" ratings are a baseline,
      no significant delays but the train might be crammed and/or we might
      wait a few minutes here or there. "good" ratings are any ride without any
      noticable delays <i>and</i> there is reasonable amount of
      space, or, <i>gasp</i>, an open seat.
